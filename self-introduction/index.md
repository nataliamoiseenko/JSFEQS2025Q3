## Transcript

Hi! My name is Natallia Asadchaya, and I'm a full-stack software engineer with 2 years of experience specializing in front-end development. I'm passionate about creating intelligent, user-centric applications.
Originally, I'm from Mogilev, Belarus, but currently I live in Wroclaw, Poland. My journey into programming has been quite unconventional. In Belarus, I spent 7 years working in economics and medical management. However, after relocating to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, I decided to completely change my career path and discovered my passion for software development. What motivated me to transition into programming was the desire to create something that could make a real impact on people's lives. That's when I first joined The Rolling Scopes School, completing the JavaScript/Front-End Pre-School course.

After earning my first certificate, I moved to Poland, where I had my first technical interviews and gained my initial internship experience. One of my key projects involved building a platform that generates personalized quiz questions using NextJS and the OpenAI API.

Currently, I'm looking for work opportunities as a Front-End Software Engineer.
My technical stack includes:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- Express
- OpenAI API
- AWS
- and HTML/CSS.

However, I believe there's always room for growth, which is why I'm joining RS School again.
My goal in joining RS School is to deepen my front-end expertise, learn modern best practices, and strengthen my foundation in core JavaScript concepts.

My professional aspiration is to become a senior front-end engineer who can architect scalable, maintainable applications and mentor junior developers. I'm motivated by the challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction of seeing users benefit from the products I build. I believe RS School's mentorship will help me achieve these goals while connecting me with a community of like-minded developers.
I'm committed to dedicating the necessary time and effort to complete this course successfully. I understand the intensity of the program, and I'm ready to embrace the challenge because I know it will significantly accelerate my professional growth.
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to being part of the EPAM Company!
